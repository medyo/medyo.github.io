Hi, I'm Mehdi Sakout, a Fullstack Developer living in Morocco with an entrepreneurial spirit, I am passionate about bringing ideas to life with my magic touch.

I was the co-founder and CTO of Mobiacube, a young agency specialized in Mobile development located in Casablanca, we served many startups and big companies.
I'm actually working with Elbotola Media, the first sport portal in Morocco,
I'm handling the mobile product in all its perspectives from prototyping to releasing... 

I'm also the co-founder of [Qudos.io](http://qudos.io) which is a weekly list of the most acurate dev tools used by developers arround the world. It's simply *Producthunt* for developmenet tools.

I'm also a KICK** FIFA 2013 player, Dortmund and Bayern munich are my weapons, I beat all teamates or almost them. Don't ask [Amine](surfeurx), he'll deny that.
